# sleep_and_lifestyle_health_analysis_report
Sleep & Lifestyle Health Analysis | SQL + Excel + Power BI

This project explores how sleep habits, stress levels, physical activity, and health indicators are connected.
Using a dataset of 374 records, I cleaned the data, built SQL insights, and created an interactive Power BI dashboard to understand health patterns.

📂 Project Files

🔧 Tools Used

Excel – Data cleaning, feature creation

SQL – Renaming columns, grouping, aggregations, insights

Power BI – Dashboard, KPIs, slicers, visualizations

🗂 Data Preparation

Cleaned column names (converted to snake_case)

Created new columns:

age_group

stress_category

bp_category (based on systolic/diastolic)

Checked for missing values

Ensured clean numeric formats for sleep, heart rate, steps, etc.

🧠 SQL Analysis Performed

Total records in the dataset

Sleep disorder distribution

Average sleep duration (by disorder, age group, occupation)

Stress level averages

BP category distribution

Average heart rate by sleep disorder

Average daily steps by sleep disorder

Sleep duration by BMI category

📊 Power BI Dashboard Highlights

KPIs:

Total BMI records

Average Heart Rate

Average Stress Level

Average Sleep Duration

Visuals Included:

Sleep disorder distribution (Donut)

BP category by stress level

Total sleep duration by BMI

Average sleep duration by age group

Average sleep duration by sleep disorder

Heart rate vs sleep duration (Scatter)

Daily steps by sleep disorder

🔍 Key Insights

Most users report no sleep disorder

Middle-aged adults have the highest stress

Older adults sleep the most

Users with no sleep disorder sleep longer on average

Prehypertension is the most common BP category

Sleep apnea users walk the most steps

Longer sleep duration relates to lower heart rate
